To run a script, go to your X profile and press "**Ctrl**" + "**Shift**" + "**J**". In the console, type "allow pasting" and press "**Enter**". After that, you can paste the script into the console and execute it using the "**Start**" option located at the top right of X.

Please note that if you delete a large number of items, your profile may appear empty due to "too many requests". It is recommended to wait **24** to **48** hours to avoid a "**Read-Only Mode**", which could last up to **7 days**.
